Spring course notes
------------------------------------

000.overview

	Spring definition:
		Integrates enterprise modules
		There is Spring framework and various projects built on top of it
		Spring framework contains various modules, like Dependency Injection, Transactional data and persistence, Web MVC, WebFlux
		Spring modules are ready for Java 9 Jigsaw
	History:
		Built in 2003
		Complements Java EE by implementing some of its JSR but ignores others
		Spring enterprise apps required a web container, later Spring boot allowed to embed the container into the app while WebFlux allows the app to run on a non web container servers
	Design philosophy
		Allows late architectural decisions
		Flexibility regarding the architectures
		Backward compatibility
		Clear API design
		High quality code
		

001.core
	
	IoC Container
	
		IoC
			IoC - Objects don't construct other objects (dependencies) but define dependencies that are injected by the container as properties (dependency injection).
			Main types: BeanFactory, ApplicationContext. Latter is a bean factory with extended capabilities, like AOP
			
		Container
			Container is represented by the org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext interface. It is configured by the means of configuration metadata (can be XML, annotations, Java code or other means).
			It describes objects of the application and their dependencies
			It has various implementations, e.g.
				ClassPathXmlApplicationContext
				FileSystemXmlApplicationContext
			Structuring multiple xml docs to config spring
				pass them all to the application context constructor or
				nest them with <import/>
			groovy is a good alternative to xml and java bean definitions
			GenericApplicationContext and XmlBeanDefinitionReader/GroovyBeanDefinitionReader can be used to mix both types of config data (groovy and xml)
			
		Beans
		    aliases
		    
		Dependencies
		    constructor injection allows specialization of arguments via types, indexes and names
		    names work only if debug flag is enabled or @ConstructorProperties annotation is present
		    @Required annotation on a setter method checks for initialization of the property
		    Singleton beans are lazy loaded by default
		Bean scopes
		Customizing the nature of a bean
		Bean definition inheritance
		Container extension points
		Annotation-based container configuration
		Class path scanning and managed components
		JSR330 standard annotations
		Java-based container configuration
		Environment abstractions
		Registering a load time weaver
		Additional capabilities of the ApplicationContext
		Bean factory
